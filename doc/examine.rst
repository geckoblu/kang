Examining a regular expression
==============================

The examine feature is useful in the event when a regex that you have been editing no longer matches the text string. In some instances you may have inadvertantly added a character. Normally, the only indication that you have that the regex doesn't match is the status bar indicator. Although this alone may be useful, Kodos provides the examine to help pinpoint errors.
